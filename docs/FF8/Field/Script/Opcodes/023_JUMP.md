**JUMP**

#### Description

Makes this entity move from its current position to the given coordinates. I'm 99% positive that the last parameter is the speed of the jump. JUMP is only used in three places in the entire game: Twice in Dollet when the two Galbadian soldiers jump off the bridge, and once in Caraway's mansion when Irvine jumps from the chair over the desk.
