|   Code   | Address | "Address" to the special variable |

#### Notes

There are 21 different special variables accessible to the script engine. There are several opcodes that access these variables in the same way, presumably they were supposed to be bit, byte and word versions of the instruction but there is absolutely no difference in the way they work.

The variables you can access through this instruction are:

| Address | Description |
|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | Active entity X mesh coordinate |
| 1 | Active entity Y mesh coordinate |
| 2 | Active entity X coordinate in mesh |

| 4 | Active entity direction (0-255) |
| 5 | Scenario parameter when entering WM from a field (see [opcode 0x318](318) |
| 6 | Field ID of "wm" field that jumped to the WM |
| 7 | Unknown |
