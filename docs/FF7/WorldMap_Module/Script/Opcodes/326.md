- Opcode: **0x326**
- Name: set window prompt
- Two-word opcode: No

#### Parameters

| Location |  Name   |       Description       |
|:--------:|:-------:|:-----------------------:|
|  Stack   | Message |    Dialog message ID    |
|  Stack   |  First  | First option message ID |
|  Stack   |  Last   | Last option message ID  |

#### Notes

Works similarly to the ASK field opcode, except there is only one window so no ID is necessary. Dialog is taken from the [mes](../../Dialog) file.

The chosen option is stored into a special variable that can be accessed with the [push special](117) instruction.
