#### Parameters

| Location | Name | Description |

| Stack | Layer ID | Which layer this animation will belong to |
| Stack | Animation ID | See the list of possible animations on the [opcode 34a](34a) page. |
| Stack | Repeat interval | How many frames between the animation repeats |

#### Notes

The animation will be positioned relative to the current active entity.

When an animation is started the engine will render a new instance of the animation using the Repeat interval. For example Repeat interval of 5 means that every 5 frames a new instance of the animation will be drawn. This is used to create effects like smoke or dust particles coming out of the current model.
