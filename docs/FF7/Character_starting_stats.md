## KERNEL.BIN - Section 4: Initialization data

This section of KERNEL.BIN contains the starting stats for the characters and related game states. On "New Game", this data is copied directly into the [Savemap](Savemap) which is explained in the "Menu" section. This data has the same format as the data explained in that section.
