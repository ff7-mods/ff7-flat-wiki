### Symptoms

When I click on game shortcut/executable I get some error suddenly, or screen goes black for a while and then it crashes back to windows.

### Causes

This can be caused by several things. One of them is using Windows XP, second is using buggy drivers for your hardware. **It can be not only your graphic drivers, but others too!**.

### Solution

First, if you're using Windows XP, try turning on Windows 95 compatibility mode (by right-clicking on shortcut, selecting Properties and in new window - Compatibility Tab). If it doesn't work, try to reinstalling drivers you installed recently. I heard that one guy solved this problem by reinstalling audio drivers and changing sound configuration in Final Fantasy VII configurator.
