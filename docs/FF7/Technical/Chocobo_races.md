title: Chocobo_races

### Symptoms

In Gold Saucer, whenever I go to Chocobo Races my game crashes to Windows. I'm using Windows 2000 or XP.

### Causes

This is a very known problem caused by bad memory allocation. Game refers to pointer that doesn't exist in memory and Windows XP doesn't allow such operations.

### Solution

Eidos has no solution to this problem besides giving you Save so you can play further in-game. This can be fixed using [Aali's OpenGL driver](http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=8306.0).
