### Symptoms

When I select *New Game* from main menu, screen goes black and nothing happens or the game crashes.

### Causes

There should be a FMV played here, and it's not because game can't find codec to play it.

### Solution

This is probably your fault - you unchecked installing DirectShow and DirectX drivers when installing the game. Game needs these drivers to show FMVs, so you must reinstall the game - checking to install these drivers. You can also try [this solution](FF7/Technical/Movies "wikilink") if installing DirectShow don't help. Or [this solution](NoMovies) if you have some codec packs installed.
