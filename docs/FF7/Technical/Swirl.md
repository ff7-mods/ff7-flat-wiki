title: Swirl
---

### Symptoms

When entering a regular battle the game crashes during the "swirl effect".

### Causes

This is presumeably caused by the game allocating memory poorly, when someone ALT-Tabs out of the game, the memory is saved, when re-entering the memory causes a glitch.

### Solution

Eidos has not provided a solution. However, Qhimm.com Forum member dziugo has created a patch that solves this problem. The patch can be found [here](http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=5572.0).
