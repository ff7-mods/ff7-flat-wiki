### Symptoms

I get one of following errors when trying to install Final Fantasy VII:

- C:\Winnt\System32\config.nt The system file is not suitable for running MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows applications. Choose 'Close' to terminate the application.
- config.nt The system file is not suitable for running MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows applications. Choose 'Close' to terminate the application.
- C:\Windows\System32\Autoexec.nt The system file is not suitable for running MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows applications. Choose 'Close' to terminate the application.

### Cause

One of following files are damaged or missing:

- autoexec.nt
- config.nt
- command.com

These files are nessesary to run older programs and games, like Final Fantasy VII.
