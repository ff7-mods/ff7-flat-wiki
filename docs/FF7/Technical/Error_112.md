title: Error_112
---

### Symptoms

During installation of Final Fantasy VII 'Error 112' is popping, preventing you from completing the installation.

### Causes

There are two known causes of this problem:

- You have insufficient disk space (depending on install type you'll need at least 260 MB for Standard Install or 460 MB for Maximum Install)
- You have too many files in your Window Temp directory

### Solution

First, check if you have enough space on your hard disk. If not, delete something :). If the problem still exists, enter your Temp directory (C:\Windows\Temp on Windows 98 or C:\Documents and Settings\\Profile Name\]\Local Settings\Temp on Windows XP) and delete everything there. This should fix the problem.
