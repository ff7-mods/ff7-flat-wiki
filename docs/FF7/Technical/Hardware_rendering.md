### Symptoms

In Final Fantasy VII Configurator I can't choose *Hardware Acceleration* in *Renderer* section. The test box on the right say's that system failed in *8-bit Paletted Textures* test.

### Causes

This is a very known problem. You probably have some modern graphic card, which Final Fantasy VII doesn't support, and that's why it won't let you select Hardware Acceleration.

### Solution

Eidos provided a patch that changes executable version to 1.02. You can download it from links below:

- [German Version](http://aaronserv.dyndns.org/hosting/ffsf/downloads/ff7_1.02g.zip)
- [Spanish Version](http://aaronserv.dyndns.org/hosting/ffsf/downloads/ff7_1.02s.zip)

You also should update your graphic drivers to newest ones. Furthermore, [Aali's OpenGL Driver](http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=8306.0) fixes more issues on even more recent hardware. Thanks to Aaron for hosting these patches.
