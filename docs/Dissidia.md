## Dissidia: Final Fantasy

**Dissidia Final Fantasy** is a video game developed by Square Enix for the PlayStation Portable as part of the campaign of the Final Fantasy series 20th anniversary. Dissidia's genre has been described as "dramatic progressive action" featuring a 3-D graphical environment with the ability to level up characters like in RPGs.

The game reunites characters from other installments of the Final Fantasy series. Chaos makes an appearance as the god of discord, while a new character, Cosmos, appears as the goddess of harmony. A total of ten villains and ten heroes, two from the first ten games in the main series, appear in a war that will determine the fate of the various Final Fantasy worlds. Chaos and the villains have seized control of ten Crystals and wounded Cosmos, and the heroes must recover these Crystals to restore Cosmos and prevent control of the worlds from falling into evil hands.

The name "Dissidia" comes from the latin word "Dissidium", which originated words such as the French word "Dissident" and the Portuguese word "Dissidente", the latter roughly meaning "one that causes conflicts".

## Miscelenous Findings

-   **Aeris** and **Tonberry** from Crises-Core can be seen in GMO files *File000895* and *File000896* respectively, even though they are not actually within the game. Presumably leftovers from testing.
